Topics Covered:
1. Types of Hackers:
	•	White Hat – Ethical hackers who help organizations improve security.
	•	Black Hat – Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
	•	Gray Hat – Hackers who may violate laws but not with harmful intent.
	•	Green Hat – Beginners eager to learn hacking.
	•	Blue Hat – Revenge-driven individuals or testers of software.
	•	Script Kiddies – Inexperienced users who rely on existing tools and scripts.
⸻
2. Phases of Hacking:
	•	Reconnaissance – Collecting information about the target.
	•	Scanning – Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
	•	Gaining Access – Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter the system.
	•	Maintaining Access – Creating backdoors to retain control.
	•	Clearing Tracks – Covering footprints to avoid detection.
⸻
3. Types of Threats:
	•	Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans)
	•	Ransomware
	•	Spyware and Adware
	•	Social Engineering
	•	Insider Threats
	•	Zero-Day Exploits
⸻
4. Common Hacking Techniques:
	•	Phishing – Tricking users to give up confidential information.
	•	Man-in-the-Middle Attack – Intercepting and possibly altering communication.
	•	Keylogging – Recording keystrokes to steal credentials.
	•	Brute Force Attack – Trying all possible combinations to crack passwords.
	•	Session Hijacking
	•	SQL Injection – Inserting malicious SQL to manipulate databases.
⸻
5. Cybersecurity Teams:
	•	Red Team – Simulates attacks to test defenses.
	•	Blue Team – Defends systems and responds to attacks.
	•	Purple Team – Works between red and blue teams to improve communication and security.
	•	(Optional if covered) Yellow/Green Teams – Focus on security in design and development phases.
⸻
Additional Concepts (Likely Discussed):
	•	CIA Triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
	•	Common cybersecurity tools (Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite)
	•	Importance of strong passwords and two-factor authentication
	•	Basic Linux terminal usage
	•	Virtual machines and Kali Linux overview
	•	Introduction to ethical hacking principles and laws
⸻
Reflection:
Today’s session laid a solid foundation in understanding the types of hackers, attack techniques, threat categories, and how cybersecurity teams are structured. It was a good mix of theory and real-world relevance, setting the stage for hands-on learning in the coming days.
